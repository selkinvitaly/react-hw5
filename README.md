It's the fifth homework for react course

This build uses [gulp 4 version](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0), so you need to install it:
```sh
npm i -g gulpjs/gulp#4.0
```

# Usage

Start server for the rest API:
```sh
npm run server
```

Start webpack-dev-server for building:


```sh
npm run watch
```
